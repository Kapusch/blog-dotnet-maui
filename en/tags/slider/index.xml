In the previous post, we saw how to move the playhead with our own Slider control. And I know it was a bit long! Hang on, we are not far from the end of this series ðŸ™‚
So today we are going to look at how to implement volume control, also with the help of a Slider.</description></item><item><title>Control the playback position with MediaElement</title><link>https://www.mauicestclair.fr/en/posts/tutos/my-first-app/11-control-playback-position-with-mediaelement/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Dec 2023 00:00:11 +0000</pubDate><author>Jean-Emmanuel BAILLAT</author><guid>https://www.mauicestclair.fr/en/posts/tutos/my-first-app/11-control-playback-position-with-mediaelement/</guid><description>â€Ž To ease your read, please resume from this chapter where we have set up the MediaElement. In the previous article, we discovered the MediaElement for playing audio files, but with the help of our own controls. Remember the Sliders we set up? They&amp;rsquo;re cool, but they&amp;rsquo;re useless! ðŸ˜„
So today, we are going to implement the playhead control, to allow the user to move to a specific frame in the track.</description></item><item><title>Music player display - Volume</title><link>https://www.mauicestclair.fr/en/posts/tutos/my-first-app/9-music-player-display-volume/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Mar 2023 00:00:09 +0000</pubDate><author>Jean-Emmanuel BAILLAT</author><guid>https://www.mauicestclair.fr/en/posts/tutos/my-first-app/9-music-player-display-volume/</guid><description>â€Ž To ease your read, please resume from this chapter where we started setting up the music player controls. In the last chapter, we worked on setting up the media playback controls. We discovered in particular a new type of button: the ImageButton component.
Today we&amp;rsquo;re going to further develop our user interface with the integration of volume controls. This is the final stretch before we start implementing the core of our music player, so hang on!</description></item><item><title>Music player display - Time tracker</title><link>https://www.mauicestclair.fr/en/posts/tutos/my-first-app/7-music-player-display-time-tracker/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Feb 2023 00:00:07 +0000</pubDate><author>Jean-Emmanuel BAILLAT</author><guid>https://www.mauicestclair.fr/en/posts/tutos/my-first-app/7-music-player-display-time-tracker/</guid><description>â€Ž To ease your read, please start from the project containing all the different steps applied so far in this tutorial. To do so, refer to the project setup guide and resume from the sample located in the folder &amp;ldquo;3 - Page Scaffolding&amp;rdquo;. In the previous article, we set up a matrix to display all the controls of our music player. So we can now add concrete elements for the user!</description></item></channel></rss>
