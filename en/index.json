For example, to retrieve data from the Cloud or react to user interactions. ‚Äé üêí‚Äé ‚Äé Indeed, I can see the separation, but why is it recommended? One of the main advantages of MVVM is isolating the view (i.e. the user interface) from the business logic. In the context of our first page, we finally obtain two files: HomeView.cs which defines exactly how our page will be displayed (i.e. a background colour, an image at the top, a bottom button), And HomeViewModel.cs which contains all the logic to run our page (in this case, the behaviour of the button when the user presses it). By following this principle, the breakdown of your code is clear and you reduce the number of lines of code per file. You wouldn‚Äôt want a file with more than 10,000 lines! üòÑ Besides, there is no risk of affecting the logic of your app if you only change the colour of a button. ‚Äé üêí‚Äé ‚Äé It‚Äôs all clear! But there‚Äôs one thing I don‚Äôt understand, there‚Äôs no Model for the HomeView page. Good catch! Indeed, some pages are so simple that they do not require a Model. In such cases, only the View and ViewModel are required.

For example, defining a button in a View and declaring its action in a ViewModel. But can you tell how they will work together? ‚Äé üêí‚Äé ‚Äé Hmm‚Ä¶ maybe tell the button in this View about what has been declared in this ViewModel? Indeed, that‚Äôs almost it! It takes place in two steps: First, a ViewModel is associated to its View (usually with the View‚Äôs BindingContext), Then we define the behaviour of each element of the View into the ViewModel, using the principle of Data Binding. Data Binding is a technique for linking two objects so that when one is changed, the other is also changed. It may sound a bit vague, but you‚Äôll understand its role better in the next section. For now, let‚Äôs move on!

Let‚Äôs start by creating a file to be the ViewModel for our HomeView. To do this, first create a new folder called ViewModels in the project, then add a new file to it. This will be an empty class named HomeViewModel.cs : Then, replace its content with the following one: Filename:HomeViewModel.cs using System; namespace NightClub.ViewModels; public class HomeViewModel { public HomeViewModel() { } async Task Enter() { await Application.Current.MainPage.DisplayAlert( \"Well Done !\", \"You have successfully reached the end of this chapter.\", \"Next !\"); } } Well, there‚Äôs nothing special here. It‚Äôs just a C# object class with an *Enter() *method that prints some text on the screen right after the user clicks the ‚ÄúENTER‚Äù button. ‚Äé üêí‚Äé ‚Äé Still, we just defined the action of the home page button! And you‚Äôre right, but as it is, it remains unusable! Fortunately, there is a library provided by Microsoft that will greatly simplify our lives: the MVVM Toolkit. This library has already been added to the project and you can easily verify this by opening the NuGet packages management window. Just right click on the project‚Äôs dependencies: And here is the library! It is called CommunityToolkit.Mvvm: ‚Äé Going further with NuGet packages Now let‚Äôs see how to prepare our class HomeViewModel to act as a real ViewModel: First, make it inherit from the class ObservableObject, then, define it as a partial class. You should have the following: Filename:HomeViewModel.cs using System; using CommunityToolkit.Mvvm.ComponentModel; namespace NightClub.ViewModels; public partial class HomeViewModel : ObservableObject ... ‚Äé By making HomeViewModel inherit from the ObservableObject class, Visual Studio automatically adds the necessary using for being compiled. Indeed, a reference to CommunityToolkit.Mvvm.ComponentModel is required for ObservableObject to become truly understandable by the application. These two steps are necessary for MVVM Toolkit to generate source code with just specific keywords. In short, you write a single word and it automatically generates dozens of lines of code, isn‚Äôt that great? ü§ò For example, we will define our Enter() method as a command by adding a simple [RelayCommand] attribute. Here‚Äôs how: Filename:HomeViewModel.cs [RelayCommand] async Task Enter() { await Application.Current.MainPage.DisplayAlert( \"Well Done !\", \"You have successfully reached the end of this chapter.\", \"Next !\"); } With just one word, we now have an Enter() command which supports the Data Binding technique! And this is only possible thanks to the MVVM Toolkit library that takes care of generating all the necessary source code. ‚Äé Going further with MVVM source code generators ","date":"12/01/2023","objectID":"/en/posts/tutos/my-first-app/4-mvvm-is-the-key-to-succeed/:0:3","tags":["MVVM","Data Binding",".NET Community Toolkit"],"title":"MVVM is the key to succeed","uri":"/en/posts/tutos/my-first-app/4-mvvm-is-the-key-to-succeed/"},{"categories":null,"content":"Demo is coming soon! Almost there! Only remaining is to activate the Enter() command when the ‚ÄúENTER‚Äù button is clicked. Let‚Äôs first reopen the file HomeView.cs to link the view to the HomeViewModel via the BindingContext: Filename:HomeView.cs public HomeView() { BindingContext = new HomeViewModel(); BackgroundColor = Colors.Black; Content = ... } Then define the action for EnterButton with BindCommand to trigger the Enter() command that is specified in the HomeViewModel: Filename:HomeView.cs Button EnterButton =\u003e new Button { Text = \"ENTER\", TextColor = Colors.White, BackgroundColor = Colors.Magenta, CornerRadius = 10 } .Bold() .Paddings(50, 2, 50, 2) .CenterHorizontal() .BindCommand(\"EnterCommand\"); // Note: we need to add \"Command\" after \"Enter\" And there you have it! ‚Äé üêí‚Äé ‚Äé Okay, so if I got it properly, it‚Äôs almost the same on every page of the app, not that complicated! Well, yes in theory!

It‚Äôs a framework maintained by Microsoft for developing mobile applications, but not only! In fact, MAUI stands for ‚ÄúMulti-platform App User Interface‚Äù. .NET MAUI was officially released during 2022 and is based on the excellent Xamarin.Forms framework which covers iOS and Android only. And if you had never heard of it, don‚Äôt panic! Even I only learned about it at the end of 2019, and then I deployed my very first app on the stores: MyVanity. ‚Äé üêí‚Äé ‚Äé And how did you get your first application published? Did it take long? And that‚Äôs the magic of .NET MAUI, you only have to code one program and it will run on Android, iOS, macOS and Windows! And it just needs a single programming language. And so no, it didn‚Äôt take that long, but mostly it will depend: your development experience, the complexity of your application, and how much time you can dedicate to it. In my case, it took exactly one year from the moment I imagined the application to the day I published it on the stores. ‚Äé üêí‚Äé ‚Äé Okay, so what do I need to know before I start my application? First of all, congratulations, it‚Äôs a very good decision! So to start your application, you will need to: Find an idea, Design a mock-up, Know C# language. First point is easy, you usually already have the idea to get this far. üòõ The second one is just to have a better idea of what the application will look like, and for that you should give a try to Adobe XD which is free! Finally, you will need to know C# language to program your application, and for that I suggest you to take the learning path developed by Microsoft. That being said, you can start right away if you have a bit of experience in coding, even without knowing C#! You will learn very quickly as you develop your application. For this first lesson, I propose you develop an application to play music in a ‚Äúnightclub‚Äù atmosphere. üíÉüèæüï∫üèªü™© You‚Äôll probably make a few mistakes, but failing is the best way to learn, so make sure you follow through with your idea! ‚Äé üêí‚Äé ‚Äé I have the idea in mind, my design is ready, and I‚Äôm fine coding with C#, let‚Äôs start !
