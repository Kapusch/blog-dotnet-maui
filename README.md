Here you will learn to build cool apps with .NET MAUI for iOS, Android, macOS, and Windows, even if you just started !

### Samples projects (tutos)
I am listing [here](https://github.com/Kapusch/blog-dotnet-maui/tree/main/Samples) all the samples projects used for the tutos from my blog. All the samples are split in different phases so that you can easily follow my tutos step by step, or even directly try-out the final result !

### Blog content
You can retrieve the raw content of my [blog](https://github.com/Kapusch/blog-dotnet-maui/tree/main/Blog) which has been [programmatically exported from Notion to Markdown files](https://github.com/Kapusch/export-notion-to-hugo).

Also, make sure to provide any [topic suggestion](https://github.com/Kapusch/blog-dotnet-maui/discussions/categories/ideas) you would be interested in !
