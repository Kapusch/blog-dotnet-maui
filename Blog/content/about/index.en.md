Hi! ðŸ‘‹ My name is J-E, I'm from South of France and I'm passionate about Cross-Platforms Mobile App Development (especially with [.NET MAUI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/maui/what-is-maui)).

With this blog, I wish I could help any beginner developer willing to get started with his mobile application project via short and simple lessons. No long theoretical courses, here you will quickly have fun and produce cool apps! And I'll guide you from the development stage until your application is available on the stores.

You'll probably make a few mistakes, but failing is the best way to learn, so make sure you follow through with your idea!
