This is usually referred as “Declarative UI” or “Fluent UI”. It’s a black background page whose content is defined by an image and a button that are stacked vertically in a VerticalStackLayout. And if you want to know how these two components are defined, just look a little further down in the code on the page: Filename:HomeView.cs #region Controls Image NightClubImage =\u003e new Image { // .NET MAUI converts SVG files to PNG files. Source = \"night_club.png\" }; Button EnterButton =\u003e new Button { Text = \"ENTER\", TextColor = Colors.White, BackgroundColor = Colors.Magenta, CornerRadius = 10 } .Bold() .Paddings(50, 2, 50, 2) .CenterHorizontal(); #endregion ‎ 🐒‎ ‎ Alright! And shouldn’t we declare an action to this button? Correct! And we’ll see how to trigger code execution by clicking on this button, but not in any way.

Let’s first see the tools you will need to develop your app. ‎ 🐒‎ ‎ By the way, do I need to be on Windows, MacOS or Linux? Actually, there is no particular pre-requisite to develop an app with .NET MAUI, unless you own a very old fashion computer and you never did update anything… 🤔 Otherwise, it’s mostly a matter of preference! Personally, I develop on macOS because it’s an operating system I like, and the built in iPhone simulator is very powerful and quickly gives me a realistic render of what I’m programming. But you can also develop under Windows or Linux! More concretely: for Windows or MacOS, it’s easy, Microsoft offers a very powerful integrated development environment: Visual Studio for Windows, and Visual Studio for Mac for… well for MacOS 😄 and if you’re on Linux, you’ll have to be a bit more resourceful (and that’s why you’re on Linux, isn’t it? 😛). In that case, I suggest you use the excellent source code editor Visual Studio Code. ‎ For the purposes of this blog, I will only focus on mobile application development using Visual Studio. It is much more intuitive to use and that is what appeals to any true novice.

To do this, go to the blog’s code repository, click on the “Code” button and download the ZIP version. ‎ Before you go further, if you are on MacOS, make sure you have downloaded the latest version of Xcode which is required for the iPhone simulator. This is usually long to install, so I suggest you do it while reading.

The project you just opened is brand new, but it includes several base files that are necessary for the proper functioning of a .NET MAUI application: All the libraries that are required for the proper functioning of the project are grouped in the Dependencies folder, In Platforms, you will find all the files needed to run the application, for each target platform, As for the Properties folder, it generally contains configuration files (and besides, there is one created by default for Windows), And then, you will be able to configure an icon and a loading screen for each application! For this, we usually use the Resources folder to store all our media (icons, images, audio and video tracks, …), Finally, we have to display something when the app opens! And for that, we have the Views folder which at the moment contains our first page, the famous home page… ‎ Going further with the basic structure of a Visual Studio project And that’s it, how about if we launch that app ? 🙂 More articles in the series: Introduction Setup the project First run of the project ","date":"01/01/2023","objectID":"/en/posts/tutos/my-first-app/2-setup-the-project/:0:3","tags":["Visual Studio","Setup","New Project"],"title":"Setup the project","uri":"/en/posts/tutos/my-first-app/2-setup-the-project/"},{"categories":null,"content":"Hi Dev-s! 🤓 I'm J-E and my goal with this blog is to help any beginner developer willing to get started with his mobile application through very simple lessons.

With this blog, I wish I could help any beginner developer willing to get started with his mobile application project via short and simple lessons. No long theoretical courses, here you will quickly have fun and produce cool apps! And I’ll guide you from the development stage until your application is available on the stores. ‎ 🐒‎ ‎ But, what is .NET MAUI? Can you tell me more? It’s a framework maintained by Microsoft for developing mobile applications, but not only! In fact, MAUI stands for “Multi-platform App User Interface”. .NET MAUI was officially released during 2022 and is based on the excellent Xamarin.Forms framework which covers iOS and Android only. And if you had never heard of it, don’t panic! Even I only learned about it at the end of 2019, and then I deployed my very first app on the stores: MyVanity. ‎ 🐒‎ ‎ And how did you get your first application published? Did it take long? And that’s the magic of .NET MAUI, you only have to code one program and it will run on Android, iOS, macOS and Windows! And it just needs a single programming language. And so no, it didn’t take that long, but mostly it will depend: your development experience, the complexity of your application, and how much time you can dedicate to it. In my case, it took exactly one year from the moment I imagined the application to the day I published it on the stores. ‎ 🐒‎ ‎ Okay, so what do I need to know before I start my application? First of all, congratulations, it’s a very good decision! So to start your application, you will need to: Find an idea, Design a mock-up, Know C# language. First point is easy, you usually already have the idea to get this far. 😛 The second one is just to have a better idea of what the application will look like, and for that you should give a try to Adobe XD which is free! Finally, you will need to know C# language to program your application, and for that I suggest you to take the learning path developed by Microsoft. That being said, you can start right away if you have a bit of experience in coding, even without knowing C#! You will learn very quickly as you develop your application. For this first lesson, I propose you develop an application to play music in a “nightclub” atmosphere. 💃🏾🕺🏻🪩 You’ll probably make a few mistakes, but failing is the best way to learn, so make sure you follow through with your idea! ‎ 🐒‎ ‎ I have the idea in mind, my design is ready, and I’m fine coding with C#, let’s start !
