My name is J-E, or Jean-Emmanuel if you prefer, and I‚Äôm glad to know you reading my notes!
Indeed, I really want to share my passion about developing cross-platforms mobile applications, and especially with .NET MAUI (to pronounce ‚Äúdot-net-mah-wee‚Äù).
With this blog, I wish I could help any beginner developer willing to get started with his mobile application project via short and simple lessons. No long theoretical courses, here you will quickly have fun and produce cool apps!</description></item></channel></rss>
