Last time, we looked at how to download music directly from the app. But it&rsquo;s been the same music from the start!
Wouldn&rsquo;t the app be much nicer if you could listen to more songs? Well that’s ideal because today we&rsquo;re integrating a music playlist!
Playlist creation To do this, let&rsquo;s define the list of songs available in the application as follows:]]></description></item><item><title>Download an audio file in .NET MAUI</title><link>https://www.mauicestclair.fr/en/posts/tutos/my-first-app/13-download-audio-file/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Dec 2023 00:00:13 +0000</pubDate><author>Jean-Emmanuel BAILLAT</author><guid>https://www.mauicestclair.fr/en/posts/tutos/my-first-app/13-download-audio-file/</guid><description>‎ To ease your read, please resume from this chapter where we have set up the MediaElement. Here we go again for a new chapter!
It&amp;rsquo;s already episode 13 of this series, so I hope it&amp;rsquo;s still relatively easy to follow! But you may have questions or comments. If you do, ask me in the comments at the bottom of the article, or e-mail me directly (jeanemmanuel.baillat@gmail.com)!
Today, we will have a look at how to enable the user to download the music that is currently playing.</description></item><item><title>Control the volume with MediaElement</title><link>https://www.mauicestclair.fr/en/posts/tutos/my-first-app/12-control-volume-with-mediaelement/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Dec 2023 00:00:12 +0000</pubDate><author>Jean-Emmanuel BAILLAT</author><guid>https://www.mauicestclair.fr/en/posts/tutos/my-first-app/12-control-volume-with-mediaelement/</guid><description>‎ To ease your read, please resume from this chapter where we have set up the MediaElement. In the previous post, we saw how to move the playhead with our own Slider control. And I know it was a bit long! Hang on, we are not far from the end of this series 🙂
So today we are going to look at how to implement volume control, also with the help of a Slider.</description></item><item><title>Control the playback position with MediaElement</title><link>https://www.mauicestclair.fr/en/posts/tutos/my-first-app/11-control-playback-position-with-mediaelement/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Dec 2023 00:00:11 +0000</pubDate><author>Jean-Emmanuel BAILLAT</author><guid>https://www.mauicestclair.fr/en/posts/tutos/my-first-app/11-control-playback-position-with-mediaelement/</guid><description>‎ To ease your read, please resume from this chapter where we have set up the MediaElement. In the previous article, we discovered the MediaElement for playing audio files, but with the help of our own controls. Remember the Sliders we set up? They&amp;rsquo;re cool, but they&amp;rsquo;re useless! 😄
So today, we are going to implement the playhead control, to allow the user to move to a specific frame in the track.</description></item><item><title>Play music in .NET MAUI with MediaElement</title><link>https://www.mauicestclair.fr/en/posts/tutos/my-first-app/10-play-music-with-mediaelement/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Sep 2023 00:00:10 +0000</pubDate><author>Jean-Emmanuel BAILLAT</author><guid>https://www.mauicestclair.fr/en/posts/tutos/my-first-app/10-play-music-with-mediaelement/</guid><description><![CDATA[‎ To ease your read, please start from the project containing all the different steps applied so far in this tutorial. To do so, refer to the project setup guide and resume from the sample located in the folder &ldquo;4 - All Media Controls&rdquo;. Before starting this new chapter, I wanted to congratulate you on all the progress you&rsquo;ve made!
Now that we&rsquo;re well advanced on the visual side, we can develop the core of the application and make it a little more functional.]]></description></item></channel></rss>
