Last time, we looked at how to download music directly from the app. But it&rsquo;s been the same music from the start!

It&amp;rsquo;s already episode 13 of this series, so I hope it&amp;rsquo;s still relatively easy to follow! But you may have questions or comments. If you do, ask me in the comments at the bottom of the article, or e-mail me directly (jeanemmanuel.baillat@gmail.com)!
