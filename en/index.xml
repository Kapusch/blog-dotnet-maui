Welcome to the final episode of this series! ‚úåÔ∏è If you&amp;rsquo;ve followed the series so far, then you should have an app you can use to listen to a few music tracks.</description></item><item><title>Listen to a playlist with MediaElement</title><link>https://www.mauicestclair.fr/en/posts/tutos/my-first-app/14-skip-next-or-previous-with-mediaelement/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Dec 2023 00:00:14 +0000</pubDate><author>Jean-Emmanuel BAILLAT</author><guid>https://www.mauicestclair.fr/en/posts/tutos/my-first-app/14-skip-next-or-previous-with-mediaelement/</guid><description><![CDATA[‚Äé To ease your read, please resume from this chapter where we have set up the MediaElement. Last time, we looked at how to download music directly from the app. But it&rsquo;s been the same music from the start!
Wouldn&rsquo;t the app be much nicer if you could listen to more songs? Well that‚Äôs ideal because today we&rsquo;re integrating a music playlist!
Playlist creation To do this, let&rsquo;s define the list of songs available in the application as follows:]]></description></item><item><title>Download an audio file in .NET MAUI</title><link>https://www.mauicestclair.fr/en/posts/tutos/my-first-app/13-download-audio-file/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Dec 2023 00:00:13 +0000</pubDate><author>Jean-Emmanuel BAILLAT</author><guid>https://www.mauicestclair.fr/en/posts/tutos/my-first-app/13-download-audio-file/</guid><description>‚Äé To ease your read, please resume from this chapter where we have set up the MediaElement.

It&amp;rsquo;s already episode 13 of this series, so I hope it&amp;rsquo;s still relatively easy to follow! But you may have questions or comments. If you do, ask me in the comments at the bottom of the article, or e-mail me directly (jeanemmanuel.baillat@gmail.com)!
Today, we will have a look at how to enable the user to download the music that is currently playing.</description></item><item><title>Control the volume with MediaElement</title><link>https://www.mauicestclair.fr/en/posts/tutos/my-first-app/12-control-volume-with-mediaelement/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Dec 2023 00:00:12 +0000</pubDate><author>Jean-Emmanuel BAILLAT</author><guid>https://www.mauicestclair.fr/en/posts/tutos/my-first-app/12-control-volume-with-mediaelement/</guid><description>‚Äé To ease your read, please resume from this chapter where we have set up the MediaElement.

So today we are going to look at how to implement volume control, also with the help of a Slider.</description></item><item><title>Control the playback position with MediaElement</title><link>https://www.mauicestclair.fr/en/posts/tutos/my-first-app/11-control-playback-position-with-mediaelement/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Dec 2023 00:00:11 +0000</pubDate><author>Jean-Emmanuel BAILLAT</author><guid>https://www.mauicestclair.fr/en/posts/tutos/my-first-app/11-control-playback-position-with-mediaelement/</guid><description>‚Äé To ease your read, please resume from this chapter where we have set up the MediaElement.

So today, we are going to implement the playhead control, to allow the user to move to a specific frame in the track.</description></item><item><title>Play music in .NET MAUI with MediaElement</title><link>https://www.mauicestclair.fr/en/posts/tutos/my-first-app/10-play-music-with-mediaelement/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Sep 2023 00:00:10 +0000</pubDate><author>Jean-Emmanuel BAILLAT</author><guid>https://www.mauicestclair.fr/en/posts/tutos/my-first-app/10-play-music-with-mediaelement/</guid><description><![CDATA[‚Äé To ease your read, please start from the project containing all the different steps applied so far in this tutorial.

This makes it easy to test new features without risking the data of our users.
In this article, I will show you how a .NET MAUI application can target different environments through multiple project configurations.
‚Äé To simplify the reading of this article, we will only focus on iOS &amp;amp; Android. However, the process is similar for other platforms.</description></item><item><title>Create a .NET MAUI App without Shell</title><link>https://www.mauicestclair.fr/en/posts/tips/maui-app-with-no-shell/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>Jean-Emmanuel BAILLAT</author><guid>https://www.mauicestclair.fr/en/posts/tips/maui-app-with-no-shell/</guid><description>Since the official release of .NET MAUI, it is not possible to create a new project where Visual Studio does not add a default Shell. Fortunately, there is a very simple way to get rid of it!
Shell or not Shell? It&amp;rsquo;s up to you! When creating a new app in .NET MAUI, Visual Studio does not offer many configuration options:
Of course, there is .NET MAUI Blazor, but it is a completely different framework.</description></item><item><title>Music player display - Volume</title><link>https://www.mauicestclair.fr/en/posts/tutos/my-first-app/9-music-player-display-volume/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Mar 2023 00:00:09 +0000</pubDate><author>Jean-Emmanuel BAILLAT</author><guid>https://www.mauicestclair.fr/en/posts/tutos/my-first-app/9-music-player-display-volume/</guid><description>‚Äé To ease your read, please resume from this chapter where we started setting up the music player controls.

In the last chapter, we worked on setting up the first visual elements of the music player. Two components were discovered: the Label and the Slider.
Today, we&amp;rsquo;re going to continue our good work and reproduce a whole series of buttons to control the media.
War of the Buttons To listen to music, our user needs key functions like: play a song, skip to the next track, etc.</description></item></channel></rss>
